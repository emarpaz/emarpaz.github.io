  Hi, I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Engineering with training in data science, sensors, and ethnography.
  <br><br>
  Here I share some samples of the work I did for my PhD dissertation at the University of Michigan. My overarching goal was to apply technology 
  to better understand drinking water quality at the tap and develop tools to provide the best quality possible.
