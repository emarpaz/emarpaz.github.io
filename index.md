### Master Projects
In 2018 I was awarded the Dow Masters Sustainability Fellowship at the University of Michigan and was involved in a 1-year long project working with a client. Together with my multidisciplinary team, we wrote this report for our client, [Isla Urbana](https://islaurbana.org/english/), where we detailed our findings and recommendations that would help them conceptualize a _conflict and concensus_ map among actors in eight axes of Mexico City's water sector. Isla Urbana oversaw the development of the project from framing the objective and the data collection approach to analysis. This report was not peer-reviewed.
